Abstract-

Ages have transformed from the equation 
Income – Expenditure = Savings  to  Income – Savings = Expenditure 
due to continuous increase in the cost of living. So, there is always a significant need of savings for this generation. Buddy Wallet took its origin from the most common Indian concept of ‘Hundi’. This project is an online wallet to save money. This wallet is not linked to any commercial purposes like recharge, bill payments, online shopping etc.., This is limited to Deposit, Withdraw and Fund Transfer to Buddy beneficiary account to purely serve the aim of saving money. Though the market is already occupied by many giant digital wallet providers, but still as software engineers, we always work for new, better & updated features.
